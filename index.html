        <h1>Epipelagic Zone (0-200 meters)</h1>
        <p>
            This layer is also called the sunlight zone and extends from the surface to 200 meters.<br>
            In this zone is where most of the visible light exists and with that comes heat - sea surface temperatures range from as high as 36°C to -2°C.<br> 
            The base of this layer is called the thermocline.
            Dolphins and Tuna: Many large fish and marine mammals, like dolphins and tuna, thrive in this zone.

        <h1>Mesopelagic Zone (200-1,000 meters)</h1>
        <p>
            Sometimes referred to as the twilight zone or the midwater zone, as sunlight is very faint.<br>
            Because of the lack of light, bioluminescence begins to appear on organisms in this zone.<br>
            The eyes on the fishes are also larger and generally upward directed, most likely to see silhouettes of other animals (for food) against the dim light.

    <section class="hidden" data-fish="DifferentFish.svg">
        <h1>Bathypelagic Zone (1,000-4,000 meters)</h1>
        <p>
            Due to its constant darkness, this zone is also called the midnight zone.<br>
            The only light at this depth and lower comes from the bioluminescence of the animals themselves.<br>
            The temperature in the bathypelagic zone, unlike that of the mesopelagic zone, is constant.<br>
            The temperature never fluctuates far from a chilling 4°C.<br>
            The pressure in the bathypelagic zone is extreme and at depths of 4,000m, reaches over 5850 pounds per square inch.<br>
            Yet, sperm whales can dive down to this level in search of food.

        <h1>Abyssopelagic Zone (4,000-6,000 meters)</h1>
        <p>
            This is the pitch-black bottom layer of the ocean.<br>
            Water temperature is constantly near freezing, and only a few creatures can be found at these crushing depths.<br>
            Three quarters of the ocean floor lies in this zone.<br>
            Challenger Deep: The deepest known point in the ocean, located in the Mariana Trench, reaches about 10,994 meters.

    <section class="hidden" data-fish="DeepestFish.svg">
        <h1>Hadalpelagic Zone (6,000-11,000 meters)</h1>
        <p>
            The deepest zone of the ocean, the temperature is constant at just above freezing.<br>
            The weight of all the water overhead in the Mariana Trench is over 8 tonnes per square inch.<br>
            Even at the very bottom, life still exists. In 2005, tiny single-celled organisms called <strong>foraminifera</strong>, a type of plankton were discovered in the Challenger Deep trench southwest of Guam.<br>
            The deepest fish ever to have been filmed, <strong>Pseudoliparis snailfish</strong>, was found 8336m down in a trench off the coast of Japan.<br>
            Ocean Trenches: This zone includes the deepest parts of the ocean, such as the Mariana Trench.<br>
            Challenger Deep: The deepest known point in the ocean, located in the Mariana Trench, reaches about 10,994 meters.
